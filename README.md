# FC-Patcher-Reset-Galileo
The FC Patcher tool allows custom firmware for many DJI aircraft. It also enables Galileo GPS on the device.  In some cases, Galileo GPS does not work well and GPS doesn't work properly. These are updated FC Patcher files which will reset Galileo back to stock. See this thread/comment for understanding of what is changed/fixed:

You still need to use these files with the rest of the FC Patcher process to create new custom firmware.
